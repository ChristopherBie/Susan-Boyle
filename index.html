                Susan Magdalane Boyle (born 1 April 1961)[1][4] is a Scottish singer, 
                who rose to fame after appearing as a contestant on the third series of 
                Britain's Got Talent, singing "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Misérables.

                Her debut studio album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 
                2009 and became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating 
                the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis.[5] I Dreamed a 
                Dream set a record for biggest first week sales by a debut album, 
                according to the Official Chart Company in the United Kingdom. Topping 
                the Billboard 200 for six weeks, it was the second best-selling album 
                of 2009 in the US. In her first year of fame, Boyle made £5 million 
                (£6.8 million today) with the release of I Dreamed a Dream and its 
                lead-off singles, "I Dreamed a Dream" and "Wild Horses".

                The success 
                was continued with her second album, The Gift (2010), where she became 
                only the third act ever to top both the UK and US album charts twice in 
                the same year, and was followed by Boyle's third album, Someone to 
                Watch Over Me (debuted at #1 on UK charts, #4 on US charts), released 
                on 31 October 2011.[7][8] Boyle subsequently released her fourth album 
                Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs from the Stage (reached #7 in UK, 
                #12 in US) in 2012,[9] her fifth album Home for Christmas (fifth 
                consecutive top ten on UK charts) in 2013,[10] and her sixth album Hope 
                (sixth consecutive top twenty on UK and US charts) in 2014.

                guest in the final, singing "You'll See".[12] The following day, she 
                performed at Windsor Castle for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Pageant 
                singing "Mull of Kintyre".[13] Having performed "I Know Him So Well" 
                in a duet with one of her idols Elaine Paige in London in December 
                2009, Boyle performed with her other musical idol Donny Osmond in Las 
                Vegas in November 2012, singing "This is the Moment", a duet from her 
                album Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From the Stage.
